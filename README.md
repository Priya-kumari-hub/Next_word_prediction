ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project is a Next Word Prediction Model built using TensorFlow & Keras. The model is trained on a text dataset to predict the most probable next word given an input sequence.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset
The model is trained on a text dataset stored in pizza.txt, which contains multiple sentences related to various topics. A tokenizer is used to preprocess the text by converting words into numerical representations.

ðŸ”¹ Model Architecture
The model is implemented using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to capture sequential dependencies in text. The architecture includes:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
LSTM Layers: Captures long-term dependencies in sequences.
Dropout Layer: Prevents overfitting.
Dense Layer with Softmax Activation: Outputs the next word prediction probabilities.
